# NFkB (NFkappaB, NF-κB) target genes
A list of NFkB (NFkappaB, NF-κB) target genes

Dr. Thomas Gilmore (Boston University) maintains a list of NFkB target genes here:
https://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/

I curated it to remove duplications and wrong information such as mislabelled access IDs or gene IDs.

For easy presentation, I compared the original list and my curated list here online [LINK](https://www.diffchecker.com/ykuzhrdz). I also attached a change.log text file.

I, Yi Liu, am a project scientist in the Alexander Hoffmann lab at UCLA. We are very much interested in the biology of NFkB family transcription factors.

Please contact me through email on my lab webpage. Thanks!
