# NFkB-gene
A List of NFkB (NFkappaB, NF-ÎºB) target genes

Dr. Thomas Gilmore (Boston University) maintains a list of NFkB target genes here:
https://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/

I curated it to remove duplications and wrong information such as mislabelled access IDs or gene IDs.

For easy presentation, I compared the original list and my curated list here online [LINK](https://www.diffchecker.com/ykuzhrdz). I also attached a change.log text file.
